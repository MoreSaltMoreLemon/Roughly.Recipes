## The Ratio-focused Recipe App

The goal: create a simple to use web-app that puts the ratios between ingredients at the forefront.

Using a starburst graph and bar graphs, we can quickly and intuitively see the proportions of our recipes, as well as edit the contents and quantities with a quick click.

Recipes can be divided into multiple step, each of which can be scaled individually.
Recipes can be shared publicly, and used by other users to create their own dishes.
